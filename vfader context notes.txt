Project: vfader.lua Script for Disting NT

Progress:
- Core Functionality: Successfully implemented the 64-fader database, page flipping via CV and encoder, and a custom UI for displaying fader names and values.
- UI Layout: Iteratively designed a zig-zag layout for fader names that allows for longer, overlapping text while protecting the screen edges.
- Parameter Implementation: Successfully implemented the `VFDR Edit Index` integer parameter (1-64).

Current Challenge:
- Undocumented Syntax: The primary obstacle is discovering the correct Lua syntax for defining a string parameter for the Disting NT firmware. This is not clearly documented in the provided manual.
- Symptoms: Our attempts have resulted in the `VFDR Name` parameter being created incorrectly, showing a value of `0` and being un-editable.
- Current State: The latest version of the script (`vfader.lua`) contains our most recent attempt at a fix: defining the string parameter with a simplified sequence `{ "VFDR Name", kNT_paramString, "FADR 01" }` and adding a safety check in the `step()` function to prevent data corruption. You are about to test this version after a reboot.
