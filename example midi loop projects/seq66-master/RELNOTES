Release Notes for Seq66 v. 0.99.22 2025-10-26 "Itsa Been Awhile"

This release contains fixes and updates for issue #141 as well as
a number of other issues discovered. Some new features to support
creating harmony more easily added.

- Issue #141, mostly implemented. See "Pattern editor" below.
- Fixed: a segfault at startup on some builds on Arch Linux.
- Main window and grid.
  - When dragging the mouse, the slot under it is drawn "flat".
  - Pressing the Menu key on a selected slot shows the popup menu.
  - Fixed: loading a file with a different PPQN set "modify".
  - Fixed: dragging a pattern set "modify" before the drag was
    completed. Could not move another pattern into the empty slot.
- Pattern editor. Extensive updates.
  - Showing note bars for scales and chords:
    - Added: a new brush called "chord" to the palette file.
    - If a chord is set, notes _not_ in the chord are grayed.
    - Added: buttons to toggle the scale/chord bars and filtering
      of off-scale/off-chord painted notes.
    - Painting notes:
      - Changed to down-snap to make note insertion nicer.
      - The selected key, scale, and chord determine the
        actual chord represented on the pattern grid.
      - Fixed the snap-interval setting for drawing notes.
    - The selected chord for a pattern, if any, is stored as a
      new track-specific "c\_musicchord" SeqSpec.
    - Removed display of time signatures in the data pane.
    - Fixed: background sequence not loaded into the piano roll.
    - Added: an option to select notes in a range of pitches.
      Either note numbers or note names can be used.
- midifile.
  - Added: storage for the first BPM value, needed by performer.
  - Fixed: Tempo event in track 0 does not override c\_bpmtag SeqSpec.
- performer.
  - Fixed: File PPQN was set when reading the file, but was not
    informing the master bus of a PPQN change (in ALSA).
  - Fixed: the slow playback of high-PPQN files.
- JACK.
  - Fixed detect\_jack() and added a missing call to jack\_free().
