ðŸŽµ F8R Dynamic Hybrid Sequencer: Functionality Outline

This script is a highly specialized Lua algorithm for the Disting NT that converts your 8 physical faders (F8R) into a massive 64-step assignment matrix used for both sequencing and continuous MIDI control.

1. Core Structure and Memory Management

Feature

Description

Total Assignments

The script manages 64 Virtual Faders which are organized into 8 Pages (8 faders per page).

Value Storage

The script maintains a memory array (self.FaderValues) that stores the last known value (0.0â€“1.0) of all 64 virtual faders, ensuring state is preserved when you switch pages.

Page Naming

The custom UI displays simplified numerical names for easy reference: PAGE 1 through PAGE 8.

2. Dynamic Hybrid Control Logic

The script's main role is to check the desired sequence length and dynamically determine the output duty of the first 8 physical faders.

Fader Role

Controlled by

Output Destination

Sequencer Steps (Pitch/CV)

If Virtual Fader Index $\le$ SequenceLength (Input 13)

CV Out (Output 1) for Pitch & Gate Out (Output 2) for Triggers.

MIDI CC Faders (Modulation)

If Virtual Fader Index $>$ SequenceLength

MIDI CC Send (Sends CC 8â€“63 based on the current page) & Mod CV Out (Output 3).

3. Sequencing and Timing Controls

The sequence is driven by dedicated external inputs. The maximum sequence length is 64 steps, spanning all 8 pages.

Input / Parameter

Functionality

Output

Input 2 (Clock In)

Reads the external clock trigger. A rising edge advances the sequence.

Gate Out (Output 2)

Input 13 (Seq Length)

Sets the Total Sequence Length (1 to 64 steps). This input determines the length of the pattern that the sequencer will loop.

N/A

Input 3 (Direction CV)

Controls the Sequence Direction. A CV signal is read and quantized to select one of 8 distinct playback modes (e.g., Forward, Reverse, Random).

N/A

Output 1 (Pitch CV)

Outputs the value (0â€“10V) of the current active step in the sequence.

Pitch CV

4. Usability and Lock Mechanisms

Feature

Functionality

Paging (Input 1)

A continuous CV input is used to linearly select and display the active bank (Page 1â€“8).

Takeover Logic

When the page is changed, the output of the 8 physical faders is locked (self.FaderTakeover). The physical fader must be moved to match the last saved value (within a 2% threshold) before it regains control, preventing abrupt jumps in the CV/CC signal.

Custom UI (draw())

Provides real-time visualization of the entire state, including the Page Name, the Current Step, the Step Count, and the Lock/Takeover status for each fader.
