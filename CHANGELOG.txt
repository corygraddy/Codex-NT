Notes: 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- VFader - When mapping a fader to a gain parameter setting the top value to 75 instead of 
100 or setting it to 25 instead of 100 does nothing. The top of the fader bar is 
still the same volume as it was. The note max and min was tested but the number wasn't. 
Either they are both bugged, so the note was broken or just the number isn't implemented yet. 
- VFader - the fader is still wobbling above 0. Should have control over that. 
- VSeq - I changed a bunch of parameters and all my triggers disappeared. I don't know what 
I did...
